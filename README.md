---

This repository contains in-class and textbook (_Java Software Solutions_) code examples for the course [Fundamentals of Computing I](https://roy.vanegas.org/teaching/at-uhart/fundamentals-of-computing-1/).


**Note**: Original textbook example codebase was riddled with trailing whitespace. Thus, students should use the enclosed copies of the textbook examples, not those provided by the publisher.
